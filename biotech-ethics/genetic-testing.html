                        Direct-to-consumer genetic testing has been a rapidly growing industry for several years now.<sup><a href="../works-cited.html#23">[23]</a></sup> These tests involve a company, such as 23andMe or Ancestry DNA, sending a kit to a consumer, with which the consumer collects a genetic sample from themselves and sends the sample back to the company. The company then analyzes that information and sends the user a report of some sort about their genetic information. These companies, in slick and impressive marketing campaigns, advertise themselves as a way to reconnect with your history, your ancestors, and even discover living relatives.<sup><a href="../works-cited.html#24">[24]</a></sup> These all seem like very good things - however, since I decided to put it here, there must be something wrong with it. So what kind of ethical issues arise when companies have access to millions of peoples’ entire genomes? Oh, wait. I get it now.

                    <p>
                        The main problem that I’d like to focus on is privacy. Privacy is, of course, a crucial concern when people’s entire genomes - highly identifiable and unchangeable information - are in question. In this sense, commercial genetic testing is probably even worse than you would imagine. Your genetic information is permanent identifying information about you - unlike, for instance, a credit card number, which can be changed if it ever gets out. In the wrong (or right, depending on your point of view) hands, your genome could be used to establish paternity of a child, accuse someone of a crime, prove genealogical connections, or even reveal private medical conditions.<sup><a href="../works-cited.html#36">[36]</a></sup> However, this issue only scratches the surface. There’s an argument to be made that if an individual decides they want to share such information about themselves and it doesn’t affect anyone else, they should be allowed to do that. But it doesn’t only affect them.

                    <h1 class="content-heading">The Golden State Killer Case</h1>
                    <p>
                        <img class="img-right" src="../Assets/golden-state-killer-drawing.jpg" />
                        From 1975 to 1986, a string of burglaries, sexual assaults, and murders was committed across California. These crimes were attributed to a mysterious “Golden State Killer,” who, after 1986, went quiet - the crimes stopped. Despite years of searching by the authorities, nothing came up. Then, in 2018, law enforcement announced that they had caught the Golden State Killer - and in June 2020, Joseph DeAngelo pleaded guilty to the crimes. About a month later, he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.<sup><a href="../works-cited.html#50">[50]</a></sup> However, Joseph DeAngelo had never taken a commercial DNA test, and he wasn’t named in the American law enforcement DNA database, called CODIS, until after he was already a suspect. So how was he captured?
                        <br><br>
                        Enter GEDmatch, an online service which allows people to upload their raw DNA test results from another provider (such as 23andMe or AncestryDNA) to be analyzed against GEDmatch’s database to find relatives.<sup><a href="../works-cited.html#34">[34]</a></sup> 23andMe and AncestryDNA both have extensive privacy policies limiting what can be done with their data - and they do not allow law enforcement to search their databases. However, GEDmatch, at the time, had no such restrictions in their terms of service.<sup><a href="../works-cited.html#54">[54]</a></sup> Again, though, DeAngelo had never taken such a test, so he wouldn’t have been in the GEDmatch database either. Instead, investigators were betting that among the 1.8 million people in the GEDmatch database would be a relative of DeAngelo’s.<sup><a href="../works-cited.html#58">[58]</a></sup> This is based on the basic principle that we are all related if you go back far enough; if you have DNA results of a third cousin of the DNA recovered from a crime scene, then you will be able to trace the family tree back to a common great-great-grandparent. If you have a second cousin, a great-grandparent. This will leave you with a long list of possible people who might be suspects, and from there, you can use information that you already have about a suspect and traditional investigation techniques to narrow down the list until you have a manageable number of people from whom to take DNA to confirm your results. 
                        <br><br>
                        In this way, your genetic material is not only identifying information about you, but also about hundreds, perhaps over a thousand of your current and future relatives. Publicly sharing your genetic information illuminates information not only about you, but also about many relatives that you may never even meet. 
                    
                    </p>

                    <h1 class="content-heading"><span id="highlight-6" class="highlight">Ethical</span> Frameworks</h1>
                    <p>
                        <img class="img-left" src="../Assets/security-camera.jpg" />
                        In many ways, this is a reproduction of a classic ethical debate between liberty and security. This is a consistent and recurring debate in political philosophy, since there is a delicate balance between the two that needs to be struck; and few agree on where such a balance should lie. The core of the argument is in the fact that, at least in most cases, these two things have trouble coexisting. Of course, if everyone has the liberty to do anything they want, that creates a world that is profoundly unsafe - that being said, if restrictions to promote safety are too heavy-handed, then we lose liberty and the freedom to live our lives in the way we wish to.
                        <br><br>
                        In the context of police use of genetic testing information, this issue slots nicely into that lens, pitting our desire for privacy — an analogue to liberty — against our desire to catch and punish criminals — an analogue to security. The argument from the liberty side is simple: catching violent criminals is an inarguable good. Therefore, any technology that leads to the capture of criminals should be used, whether or not it harms privacy. The idea is that the threat to one’s privacy does not equate with the harms caused by violent crime, and so any privacy concerns cannot outweigh the benefits of its use by law enforcement.<sup><a href="../works-cited.html#54">[54]</a></sup>
                        <br><br>
                        The argument from the other camp, the one more skeptical of the widespread use of commercial genetic testing information based on privacy concerns, is a little more nuanced, and there are many different ways of reaching the same conclusion. For instance, take trust of the police, for one. The police have a long history of being, to be quite honest, pretty bad at their jobs.<sup><a href="../works-cited.html#40">[40, 41]</a></sup> In addition to being (sometimes) very bad at solving crime, they also have a long history of targeting minority groups and using excessive force, often committing acts that are wildly illegal in the name of solving or reducing crime. <sup><a href="../works-cited.html#47">[47, 56]</a></sup> There is quite a solid standing for the argument that the police do not have a claim to using very sensitive genomic data about millions of people until they demonstrate that they can use it safely, equitably, and effectively. 
                        <br><br>
                        Another tack that one could use to make this argument would be that of data breaches. These are very common, even in institutions that are supposed to have some the best security in the world to protect our sensitive information, like banks.<sup><a href="../works-cited.html#53">[53]</a></sup> However, direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies are regulated far, far less strictly than banks. This means that a significant data breach of a genetic testing company is probably significantly more likely than one of a major bank. Even leaving aside the possibility of a data breach, a particularly unscrupulous genetic testing company could sell genetic testing data as a part of its business model. In fact, some of them already do.<sup><a href="../works-cited.html#45">[45]</a></sup>
                        <br><br>
                        There are a lot of things to be concerned about when it comes to biotechnology, but this one, in my opinion, doesn’t receive nearly enough attention. Your genetic information contains information that could be used to discriminate, target ads, set health insurance premiums based on genetic disease risk, identify you and hundreds of your relatives, and many other possibilities that we might not even be able to fathom right now. Maybe we should be wary of putting it into anyone’s hands.
